# Testing GMT design template

Template will be used in CMS, need to test responsiveness and browser compatibility

## Chrome

Testing complete, looks good, responsive styles working correctly

## Firefox

Changed .insidesidemenu to suit responsive styles appears to be working correctly now

## Safari

Testing complete, looks good, responsive styles working

## Internet Explorer

xl and lg screen look fine, however when reduced to md the search and hamburger menu icon are misaligned

## Opera

Set background-color in the gradient top bar as this was not showing.  Icons, fonts sized wrong, spacing incorrect, round images mis-shaped.
Tried on a different computer and is now showing perfectly, perhaps I had an outdated version.
